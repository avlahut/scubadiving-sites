I dove %s on Saturday.
I want to dive %s while I am in West Palm Beach in June.
The %s is a fine wreck if you like that sort of thing.
% is about an hour south and is a good dive.
Another vote for a drive down to % for a beach dive.
As others have mentioned, the % is a world class site for the unusual and macro.
